To compile easymake manually, you must do so using either tcc, gcc, clang or MSVC.
Here are instructions for compiling with either of those three compilers:

tcc:
  tcc src/*.c -Iinclude -O3 -o easymake

gcc:
  gcc src/*.c -Iinclude -s -O3 -o easymake

clang:
  clang src/*.c -Iinclude -O3 -o easymake

MSVC:
  cl src/*.c /I include /O2
